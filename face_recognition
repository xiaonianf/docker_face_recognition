#使用face_distance 函数，通常不是只检查两张脸是否匹配（真或假），而是看看它们有多相似。
# Often instead of just checking if two faces match or not (True or False), it's helpful to see how similar they are.
# You can do that by using the face_distance function.

#该模型的训练方式是，距离小于等于 0.6 的人脸应该是匹配的。 但是如果你想更严格，可以找更小的人脸距离。 例如，使用 0.55 截止值会减少错误
# The model was trained in a way that faces with a distance of 0.6 or less should be a match. But if you want to
# be more strict, you can look for a smaller face distance. For example, using a 0.55 cutoff would reduce false
# positive matches at the risk of more false negatives.

#注意：这与“百分比匹配”并不完全相同。 比例不是线性的。 但是你可以假设图像带有较小的距离比较大的距离更相似。
# Note: This isn't exactly the same as a "percent match". The scale isn't linear. But you can assume that images with a
# smaller distance are more similar to each other than ones with a larger distance.
